import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;

public class JavaConstructor {
//it is used to create an instance and initialise the instance variables
//Its similar to method except:
//    a. Name:  constructor name is same as class name
//    b. Return Type: constructor do not have any return type
//    c. Constructor cannot be static or final or abstract or synchronized.

public class Employee{
    public int empId;

    Employee(){
        // constructor
    }
    // methods can have same name as class name. This is totally valid
    int Employee(){
        // method
    }
}
Employee e = new Employee();
//    This new Employee() essentially tells java to call the constructor at the runtime and not the method(bcoz we can also have method with same name as class name)
//    Constructor doesnt have a return type. Java implicitly adds return type as class, because we need an object of class itself.
//    A method will always have a return type. This differentiates a method with the constructor


//    Why constructor doesn't have a return type?
//    Why constructor cannot be final?
//    Why constructor cannot be abstract?
//    Why constructor cannot be static?
//    Can we define constructor in interface?
//    Why constructor name is same as class name?


//    Why constructor doesn't have a return type?
//    - You can have a method whose name is same as class name. But that method will always have some sort of return type. Even if it returns nothing we'll use void as the return type. This property of not having a return type differentiates a constructor from a method.
//      So using this 2 features, first constructor name is same as class name. Second, constructors dont have any return type, we can easily identify which is the constructor in our class.


//    Why constructor cannot be final?
//    -  method which is declared final cannot be overriden. Why because final method cannot be changed. So there is no point in overriding the method
//    For ex: assume you have created 2 classes Employee and Manager. Manager extends Employee class, so all the methods and instance variables of Employee class are inherited by Manager class
//    Employee(parent class) ---> Manager (child class)

//    A constructor‚Äôs job is to initialize the state of the current class‚Äôs object, not the parent class‚Äôs object. Each class defines its own constructors.
//    However, when you create a child class object, the parent constructor is still called (either explicitly via super(...) or implicitly via super()), but it‚Äôs not inherited ‚Äî it‚Äôs just invoked.

//    Constructors are not inherited, but lets say for understanding purpose it does. Constructor rule is its name should be same as class name.
//    So Manager class will treat Employee as a method (not as constructor, because for Manager class Manager should be the constructor) and thus will expect some return type as well, which it doesnt have.
//    hence constructors are never inherited.

//    final in Java means: cannot be overridden.
//    But constructors are not inherited, so overriding doesn‚Äôt apply to them.
//    Since you can‚Äôt override a constructor, making it final has no meaning. That‚Äôs why Java doesn‚Äôt allow it.

//    A constructor cannot be final because it cannot be overridden(and this is bcoz we cannot inherit the constructors, hence overriding doesnt apply to them),
//    and final is used to prevent overriding.


        public class Employee{
            Employee(){
                // constructor
                System.out.println("parent class constructor");
            }
        }

        public class Manager extends Employee{
            // inside Manager class, java will treat Employee() as method and thus it must have some return type
            void Employee(){

            }

            // Manager class's constructor
            Manager() {
                super();    // calls parent class constructor
                System.out.println("child class constructor");
            }
        }


//    Why constructor cannot be abstracted?
//    To create an abstract method, we need an abstract class, lets say Employee, and in abstract method, we define only declaration and not defination
//    When I create a subclass which extends this abstract class, responsibility of providing the implementation of abstract method is on subclass.
//    So child class has to provide the implementation. But we know, constructors cannot be inherited. So if you cannot inherit it, how will you provide the implementation.
//    Hence constructors cannot be abstracted.

//    abstract means: must be overridden in a subclass.
//    But constructors are never inherited and thus cannot be overridden.
//    Each class must define its own constructor.

//üëâ If Java allowed abstract constructors, subclasses would be forced to implement/override them, but that concept makes no sense.

    public abstract class Employee{
        abstract Employee();       //  Not allowed
        public abstract void print();
    };

    public class Manager extends Employee{
        @Override
        public void print(){
            // provide implemetation
        }
    };



//    Why constructor cannot be static?
//    static methods can only access static variables & static methods. It cannot access non static instance variables, because it is not aware of which object it belongs to.
//    So if you define the constructor static, you wont be able to initialize the non static instance variables.
//
//    2nd problem: It is related to chaining. If you declare constructor static, you wont be able to use super()

    class Employee{
        int empId;

        // marking Constructor static - then you wont be able to initialse non static member variables
        // Incorrect
        static Employee(int val){ // X (static) Not allowed
            empId = value;
        }
    }

//    static means: belongs to the class, not to an object.
//    But constructors are meant to initialize objects, so they‚Äôre tied to object creation, not the class itself.
//    If constructors were static, they could be called without creating an object ‚Äî which defeats their whole purpose.


//    Can we define constructor in interface?
//    We know that in interface, we only provide method declaration, no definition/body. Subclass which implements this interface needs to provide the implementation of this method.
//    You cannot instantiate or create an object of an interface. You can only instantiate Manager class & for that you will need a constructor, because constructor is used to create and initialise the object/instance.
//    For interface, anyway you cannot instantiate it. Hence concept of constructors doesn't apply to interfaces
        Employee e = new Employee(); // X Invalid

interface Employee{
    void print();
}

class Manager implements Employee{
    void print(){
        // provide implementation
    }
}

//üëâ ‚ÄúBy default, interfaces only provide method declarations and not definitions.
//    However, starting with Java 8, interfaces can also contain default and static methods with implementations,
//    and from Java 9, even private methods.‚Äù


//    Why constructor name is same as class name? - This is because it is easy to identify which one is the constructor in a class if you have a bunch of methods
