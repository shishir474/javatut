public class SuperClassAndSubclass {
    A class that is derived frmo another class is called Subclass.
    and class through which subclass is derived is called superclass.

    ðŸ”¹ The Object Class in Java
        In Java, every class implicitly extends Object if no other superclass is specified.
        Object is the root (topmost) class in the Java class hierarchy.
        This means all classes in Java are direct or indirect subclasses of Object.

    ðŸ”¹ Example
        class Person {
            // This class does not explicitly extend anything
            // But internally, it is treated as: class Person extends Object
        }

        class Engineer extends Person {
            // Subclass of Person
        }

    Here:
        Person extends Object (implicitly).
        Engineer extends Person, and therefore also inherits from Object indirectly.

    ðŸ”¹ Why Object is important
        The Object class provides common methods that every Java object can use:

        toString() â†’ Returns a string representation of the object.
                Default: className@hashcode
        Usually overridden for meaningful output.

        equals(Object obj) â†’ Compares two objects for equality.
                Default: checks reference equality (==).
        Often overridden to compare object contents.

        hashCode() â†’ Returns an integer hash value for the object.
        Used in collections like HashMap, HashSet.
        Must be consistent with equals().

        clone() â†’ Creates and returns a copy of the object (shallow copy).
        Requires implementing Cloneable interface.

        getClass() â†’ Returns the runtime class of the object.

        finalize() â†’ Called by the Garbage Collector before object destruction (deprecated in Java 9+).

        notify(), notifyAll(), wait() â†’ Methods for thread communication (used in synchronization).


    ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways
    Even if you donâ€™t extend anything, your class automatically extends Object.
    All classes in Java inherit these methods from Object.
    You can override methods like toString(), equals(), and hashCode() to make them more meaningful.

    Conclusion: Every class in Java is inheriting Object class directly or indirectly.


    class ObjectTest{
         public static void main(String args[]){
//             child object can be stored in parent class reference
             // Object class is the topmost/ultimate parent of every class and thus we can store the reference of Person and Audi objects inside Object class
            Object ob1 = new Person();
            Object ob2 = new Audi();
            System.out.println(ob1.getClass());     // class Person
             System.out.println(ob2.getClass());    // class Audi
         }
    }
