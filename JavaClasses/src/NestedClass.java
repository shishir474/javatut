public class NestedClass {

    Class within another class is called nested class.

    When to use?
    If you know that a class (A) will be used by only one another class (B), then instead of creating new file (A.java) for it, we can create nested class inside B itself.
    It allows us to group logically related classes in one file.

    Scope:
    Its scope is same as of its outer class

    Nested class is of 2 types
        static nested class
        non static nested class / inner class
            a. member inner class
            b. local inner class
            c. anonymous inner class



}
